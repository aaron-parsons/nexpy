NeXpy: A Python GUI to analyze NeXus data
=========================================

NeXpy provides a high-level python interface to `NeXus data 
<http://www.nexusformat.org/>`_ contained within a simple GUI. It is designed to 
provide an intuitive interactive toolbox allowing users both to access existing 
NeXus files and to create new NeXus-conforming data structures without expert 
knowledge of the file format.

.. warning:: The official NeXpy v0.1 has not yet been released. The current
             version is functional but is not yet fully stable. A stable version 
             should be available shortly in September, 2013.
