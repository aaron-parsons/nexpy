Introduction
============
NeXpy provides a high-level python interface to NeXus data contained within a
simple GUI. It is designed to provide an intuitive interactive toolbox allowing users both
to access existing NeXus files and to create new NeXus-conforming data
structures without expert knowledge of the file format.

Installing and Running
======================

    python setup.py install

To install in an alternate location:

    python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/insallation/dir


Prerequisites (must install before you can run)
===============================================

PySide v1.1.0        http://www.pyside.org/
iPython v0.13        http://ipython.org/
numpy,scipy          http://numpy.scipy.org
matplotlib v1.1.0    http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net    (GUI only)
hdf5                 http://www.hdfgroup.org
mxml                 http://www.minixml.org
nexus                http://www.nexusformat.org

The following environment variables may need to be set
NEXUSLIB --> /point/to/lib/libNeXus.so
PYTHONPATH --> must include paths to ipython,numpy,scipy,matplotlib if installed in nonstandard place

All of the above are included in the Enthought Python Distribution v7.3.

PyQt4 should also work instead of PySide. NeXpy automatically checks for 
which PyQt variant is available (PySide or PyQt4 - not PyQt). 

To run with the GUI
===================

You can run both from the source location or from the install location. To run
from the source directory, simply execute:

    scripts/nexpy

To run from the install location, add the $prefix/bin directory to your path
(only if you installed outside the python installation), and then run:

    nexpy
